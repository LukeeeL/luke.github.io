I am of Chinese ethnicity, 
although I was born and raised
in New Zealand. Originally both 
my parents lived in China before 
coming to New Zealand for 
university. At home, I am mostly
immersed in the Chinese culture,
such as eating Chinese foods, 
celebrating holidays/festivals and 
speaking mainly Mandarin. The 
rest of my family still resides in 
China, which we visit every year.
