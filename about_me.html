<p>Kia ora whanau, 你好, Hello. I am Luke Lin, 
I was born on the first of October 2008. 
I am currently a year 10 student at 
Botany Downs Secondary College. I live 
with my mum and dad in Auckland,
New Zealand. I attended Somerville 
Intermediate and have been in 
New Zealand all my life. I strive to be 
the best I can be and to never give up
in the face of challenge. 
</p> 
<p>
My goals are to succeed in academics so 
that I am able to study medicine and 
become a doctor. I will do this by working 
hard and being persistent.  
</p>
