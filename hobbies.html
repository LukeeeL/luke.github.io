Some of my hobbies that I enjoy doing is playing sports and playing games in my spare time. Some sports I play frequently include Squash, Table Tennis, and Badminton. The sport I play the most is squash. I've played squash for around 5 years and I am number 1 for the school A team and I also compete in several regional tournaments. I am also apart of the school Table Tennis A team. I also enjoy playing video games with my friends in my free time.
